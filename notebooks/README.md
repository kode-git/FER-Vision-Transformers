# Notebook List

| Name       | Description      | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Data_Integration      | This notebook displays features about the original datasets of our projects and integrate them in a result dataset. | 
|  Data_Analysis      | In these sections, we will see some data analysis on the result integration on the final proposed dataset.|
| Preprocessing | Preprocessing phase changes the format of images from gray-scale to RGB with a correct values distributions in channels. Hence, transforms .png images in .jpg and then apply the data augmentation. | 
| Training | This notebook sets the environment for training proposed models. | 
| Evaluation | After a long training phase, we display the results on some principal classification metrics in this notebook. | 
| Face_Crop | It is the notebook for the demo application using Single-Shot Detector for the face detenction and cropping, then classify the face in one of the eight supported emotions using one of our models. | 

It is preferible to open notebook in a Colab environment with GPU setup. During training and evaluation we used a NVIDIA P100 with 16 GB of RAM, similar or GPU configuration with better performances are strongly recommended.
